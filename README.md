# Claude Code Starter Kit

A repository of reusable configuration files, documentation layers, custom commands, MCP configurations, and prompt templates for Claude Code. Pull from this kit every time you start a new software project to eliminate the cold-start problem.

**This is NOT an application template or code scaffolding tool.** It contains no application code. It is purely an AI development environment configuration kit — everything Claude Code needs to understand how you work, what your standards are, and how to produce code that matches your expectations.

## How to Use the Layer System

The CLAUDE.md layer system lets you compose a project-specific `CLAUDE.md` from pre-written modules. Every project gets a tailored set of instructions without writing from scratch.

### How Layers Are Split

Layers are organised across three tiers:

| Tier | Layer | File | Destination |
|------|-------|------|-------------|
| Universal | `universal` | `layers/base/universal.md` | `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` (user memory) |
| Language | `java` | `layers/tech/java/CLAUDE.md` | Project `CLAUDE.md` |
| Stack | `spring-boot`, `react`, `kafka`, `spark-java` | `layers/tech/*/CLAUDE.md` | Project `CLAUDE.md` |
| Database | `mysql`, `postgres`, `mongodb`, `dynamodb` | `layers/tech/*/CLAUDE.md` | Project `CLAUDE.md` |
| Domain | `domain` | `layers/domain/CLAUDE.md` | Project `CLAUDE.md` |

The `universal` layer is written to `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` by default so that stack-agnostic standards apply to **every project automatically**, without cluttering each project's `CLAUDE.md`. All other layers are written to the project file.

### Composing a CLAUDE.md

```bash
cd layers/
./compose.sh /path/to/your/project/CLAUDE.md universal java spring-boot react
```

This writes `universal` to `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` and assembles the remaining layers into the project file.

**Options:**

| Flag | Effect |
|------|--------|
| `--no-user-memory` | Write all layers into the project file instead of routing universal to user memory |
| `--user-memory <path>` | Override the user memory destination (default: `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`) |
| `--force` | Overwrite an existing user memory file that was not generated by compose.sh |

### Common Combinations

| Project Type | Layers |
|-------------|--------|
| Spring Boot API (MySQL) | `universal java spring-boot mysql domain` |
| Spring Boot API (Postgres) | `universal java spring-boot postgres domain` |
| Spring Boot + React SaaS | `universal java spring-boot mysql react domain` |
| Spring Boot + Kafka | `universal java spring-boot postgres kafka domain` |
| Full stack with events | `universal java spring-boot mysql react kafka domain` |
| Spring Boot + MongoDB | `universal java spring-boot mongodb domain` |
| Spark data pipeline | `universal java spark-java domain` |

### Customising After Composition

Every generated project `CLAUDE.md` includes a `PROJECT ADDITIONS` footer. Add project-specific overrides there. To promote a useful convention back to the kit, use the `/promote` skill (see below).

---

## How to Use Custom Commands

Custom commands are prompt files that Claude Code follows to generate, analyse, or refactor code.

### Setup

Copy the commands you need to your project's `.claude/commands/` directory:

```bash
mkdir -p /path/to/your/project/.claude/commands
cp commands/generation/new-entity.md /path/to/your/project/.claude/commands/
cp commands/analysis/review.md /path/to/your/project/.claude/commands/
# ... copy whichever commands you use
```

Or copy all commands at once:

```bash
cp -r commands/* /path/to/your/project/.claude/commands/
```

### Using Commands

In Claude Code, invoke a command by referencing it:

```
/new-entity Product
```

Or ask Claude Code to follow the command:

```
Follow the new-entity command to create a Product entity with fields:
- name (String, required, max 255)
- price (BigDecimal, required)
- sku (String, required, unique per tenant)
- status (ProductStatus: ACTIVE, DISCONTINUED)
```

### Available Commands

**Generation** — Create new code following project patterns:
- `new-entity` — Complete feature package (entity, repository, service, controller, DTOs, tests, migration)
- `new-endpoint` — Add endpoint to existing feature
- `new-migration` — Flyway migration with rollback
- `new-kafka-topic` — Full Kafka setup (producer, consumer, config, tests)
- `new-react-page` — Page with routing, API integration, and state handling
- `new-react-component` — Reusable component with typing and tests

**Analysis** — Review code for quality and consistency:
- `review` — Full code review against CLAUDE.md standards
- `security-check` — Security vulnerability scan
- `test-gaps` — Missing test coverage analysis
- `dependency-check` — Dependency health and vulnerability check
- `api-consistency` — REST API consistency audit

**Refactoring** — Improve existing code:
- `extract-service` — Move business logic from controller to service
- `add-validation` — Add comprehensive input validation
- `add-tests` — Generate missing tests for existing code
- `optimise-query` — Database query analysis and optimisation

## How to Use the /promote Skill

The `/promote` skill lets you backport a convention discovered during a project back into this kit. Install it once at user level and it is available in every project.

### Setup

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills/promote
cp skills/promote/SKILL.md ~/.claude/skills/promote/
```

### Usage

From any project, run `/promote` and describe the convention. Claude Code will locate the correct source layer in claude-docs, update it, commit the change, and open a PR for review.

## How to Set Up MCP Servers

MCP servers give Claude Code access to external tools: databases, Docker, web search, and more.

1. Copy the template: `cp mcp/mcp-config-template.json /path/to/your/project/.claude/mcp.json`
2. Edit the configuration with your project's connection details.
3. Remove servers you do not need.
4. Follow `mcp/setup-guide.md` for detailed setup and verification instructions.

---

## How to Use Prompt Templates

Prompt templates are for complex, multi-step scenarios that go beyond what a custom command covers.

Copy the relevant prompt, fill in the bracketed sections with your specific context, and paste it into Claude Code.

| Prompt | When to Use |
|--------|------------|
| `system-design` | Starting a new feature — think before coding |
| `debugging` | Stuck on a bug — systematic investigation |
| `performance` | Something is slow — diagnose and optimise |
| `migration-planning` | Big refactor or data migration — plan carefully |
| `code-archaeology` | Unfamiliar codebase — systematic exploration |
| `mvp-scoping` | New product idea — scope the minimum viable build |
| `domain-discovery` | New business domain — extract structured knowledge |

## Contributing Back to the Kit

When you discover a useful pattern during a project, promote it back into the kit.

**From inside a project:** Run `/promote` — the skill handles locating the right layer, editing it, committing, and opening a PR.

**Manually:**
- New convention → add it to the appropriate layer file under `layers/`
- New custom command → add it to `commands/` in the appropriate category
- New prompt pattern → add it to `prompts/`
- New MCP server → add it to the template and setup guide

Keep the kit evolving. Every project should leave this repository a little better than it found it.
